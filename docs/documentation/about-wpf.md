# What is WPF

WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) is a resolution-independent UI framework for building Windows desktop applications. It provides vector-based graphics, advanced layout, data binding, multimedia, animation, and extensive styling and templating capabilities.

## .NET Framework vs Modern .NET

WPF has two implementations:

**Modern .NET** (.NET 6+): Open-source implementation hosted on GitHub. Provides improved performance, new APIs, side-by-side deployment, and modern tooling. Despite .NET being cross-platform, WPF only runs on Windows.

**.NET Framework 4**: Legacy Windows-only implementation. Maintained for compatibility with existing applications but receives minimal new features.

New WPF applications should target modern .NET (.NET 6 or later) to benefit from:

- Better performance and reduced memory usage
- Regular updates and new features
- Modern C# language versions
- Improved debugging and diagnostics
- Side-by-side deployment without machine-wide installations
