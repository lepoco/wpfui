# Introduction

WPF UI is a library designed for building modern user interfaces in a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) environment.  
By default, the library is created for `.NET 6`. If you want to know more about .NET 6, [have a look here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-6).

### 🚀 Getting started

Before you start playing around with **WPF UI**, we recommend that you familiarize yourself [with the WPF basics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/get-started/create-app-visual-studio?view=netdesktop-6.0).  
When you know more or less what and how, [see our tutorial](https://wpfui.lepo.co/tutorial/tutorial.html).

### Windows Presentation Foundation

Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is a free and open-source graphical subsystem (similar to WinForms) originally developed by Microsoft for rendering user interfaces in Windows-based applications.

## Pricing

**WPF UI** is free software. Free in the context of freedoom. I believe that helping other creators achieve the expected results is a great form of cooperation. If you are just learning or creating private applications, don't feel obligated to do anything at all, although if you see a bug, reporting it would be appreciated.

In any case, if your company uses **WPF UI**, I encourage you to provide one-time or monthly support using GitHub sponsors.
