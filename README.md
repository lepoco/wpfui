## üìñ Documentation

Documentation can be found at https://wpfui.lepo.co/. We also have a [tutorial](#-getting-started) over there for newcomers.

## üöß Development

If you want to propose a new functionality or submit a bugfix, create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/lepoco/wpfui/compare/main...main) for the branch [main](https://github.com/lepoco/wpfui/tree/main).

## üìê How to use?

First, your application needs to load custom styles, add in the **MyApp\App.xaml** file:

```xml
<Application
  ...
  xmlns:ui="http://schemas.lepo.co/wpfui/2022/xaml">
  <Application.Resources>
    <ResourceDictionary>
      <ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
        <ui:ThemesDictionary Theme="Dark" />
        <ui:ControlsDictionary />
      </ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
    </ResourceDictionary>
  </Application.Resources>
</Application>
```

If your application does not have **MyApp\App.xaml** file, use `ApplicationThemeManager.Apply(frameworkElement)` to apply/update the theme resource in the `frameworkElement`.

```C#
public partial class MainWindow
{
    public MainWindow()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        ApplicationThemeManager.Apply(this);
    }
}
```

Now you can create fantastic apps, e.g. with one button:

```xml
<ui:FluentWindow
  ...
  xmlns:ui="http://schemas.lepo.co/wpfui/2022/xaml">
  <StackPanel>
      <ui:TitleBar Title="WPF UI"/>
      <ui:Card Margin="8">
          <ui:Button Content="Hello World" Icon="{ui:SymbolIcon Fluent24}" />
      </ui:Card>
  </StackPanel>
</ui:FluentWindow>
```

## Special thanks

Crafting apps for .NET without the creators of tools like ReSharper or XAML Styler would never be such a fantastic adventure.

- [üîó XAML Styler](https://github.com/Xavalon/XamlStyler)

JetBrains was kind enough to lend a license for the open-source **dotUltimate** for WPF UI development. Learn more here:

## Microsoft Property

Design of the interface, choice of colors and the appearance of the controls were inspired by projects made by Microsoft for Windows 11.  
The Wpf.Ui.Gallery app includes icons from _Microsoft WinUI 3 Gallery_ app. They are used here as an example of creating tools for Microsoft systems.

## Segoe Fluent Icons

**WPF UI** uses Fluent System Icons. Although this font was also created by Microsoft, it does not contain all the icons for Windows 11. If you need the missing icons, add Segoe Fluent Icons to your application.  
According to the EULA of Segoe Fluent Icons we cannot ship a copy of it with this dll. Segoe Fluent Icons is installed by default on Windows 11, but if you want these icons in an application for Windows 10 and below, you must manually add the font to your application's resources.  
[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/style/segoe-fluent-icons-font](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/style/segoe-fluent-icons-font)  
[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/downloads/#fonts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/downloads/#fonts)

In the app dictionaries, you can add an alternate path to the font

```XML
<FontFamily x:Key="SegoeFluentIcons">pack://application:,,,/;component/Fonts/#Segoe Fluent Icons</FontFamily>
```
